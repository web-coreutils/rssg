# RSS SSG

## Text format specification
- Just write the urls down one at a time.
- Comments are not allowed since they could all be valid URLs
- empty lines are okay

Note that this is still a WIP, we will probably switch to sth like yml/toml soon...

Example: 
```
<URL_TO_RSS_OR_ATOM_FEED>
<URL_TO_RSS_OR_ATOM_FEED>
<URL_TO_RSS_OR_ATOM_FEED>
...
```
